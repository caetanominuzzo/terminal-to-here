# Terminal-To-Here Extension for Visual Studio Code

This extension, "terminal-to-here", provides two useful commands for interacting with the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code:

- `cdToCurrentFile`: Change the directory of the current terminal to the directory of the currently open file.
- `newTerminalInCurrentFile`: Create a new terminal with its working directory set to the directory of the currently open file.
- `navigateUp`: Change the current terminal's directory to the parent directory.

## Features

- Change the current terminal's working directory to match the currently open file's directory with `cdToCurrentFile`.
- Open a new terminal with its working directory set to the currently open file's directory with `newTerminalInCurrentFile`.
- Easily navigate up one directory level from the current terminal's location with `navigateUp`.

All three commands can be run from the Command Palette (View -> Command Palette, or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux), or you can assign them to custom keyboard shortcuts through VS Code's Keyboard Shortcuts editor.
